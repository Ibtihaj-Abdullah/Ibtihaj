🚀 **What I Do:**

* ☁️ **Cloud Expertise:** Proficient in Azure (App Service, SQL Database, VNet, ARM templates, Azure Functions) and AWS (EC2, IAM, S3). [cite_start]I ensure global availability and cost-effective scalability using High Availability SLAs and autoscaling[cite: 7, 29, 31, 33].
* [cite_start]⚙️ **DevOps Automation:** I automate workflow tasks (achieving up to 300% efficiency!), manage end-to-end CircleCI CI/CD pipelines, and integrate them with Jira for streamlined project management[cite: 11, 14, 15].
* [cite_start]📊 **Monitoring & Logging:** Automated logs visualization and retention using Grafana, Promtail, Loki, and S3[cite: 16].
* [cite_start]🤖 **AI/ML Integration:** Deployed AI-enabled agriculture disease prevention systems on Azure [cite: 6] [cite_start]and conducted research on protecting smart grids using deep learning[cite: 8]. [cite_start]I've also developed deep learning models for harassment detection and AI-based systems for crop and weed detection[cite: 47, 49].
* [cite_start]🐍 **Scripting & Infrastructure:** Extensive work with Bash, SSH, Docker, and Terraform for test infrastructure deployment[cite: 18, 19].
